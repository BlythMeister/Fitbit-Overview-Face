## Donations

## Why Have Donations?

I think this is a useful tool and that part of using open source tooling is to be able to donate something back to the community.

Some people can donate time (either by raising issues, fixing issues or something as small as fixing a spelling error) whilst others can donate financially to help with any running costs associated with the app.

## Donations Not Licences

The donation model offered by my software is not an offer of lifetime support for your single donation.

## Donation Links

All donation links can be found on my [personal blog](https://www.blyth.me.uk/donations)
