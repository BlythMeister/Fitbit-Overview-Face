# How To Contribute

The editor for Fitbit clock faces is online at https://studio.fitbit.com

To contribute, you need to create your own empty project on this site and upload all files in `src\348x250`, `src\300x300` or `src\366x366` depending on watch face version to edit.

NOTE: Some changes should be applied to all versions (i.e. a bug fix which effected all)

You will be able to test by either side-loading onto an actual watch in developer mode, or using the simulator.

To commit changes you need to export the project (under the download menu) and update the files on GitHub.

Finally, you can raise a pull request for me to review!

Fitbit have said they are looking to introduce GitHub support from within their Studio site, so this should make the process easier once they complete this work!
